# main contributions
1.difference between anchor-based and anchor-free detectors is actually how to define positive and negative training samples
2.automatically select positive and negative training samples according to statistical characteristics of object
3.not need to tile multiple anchors per location on the image to detect objects, that is just the right quantity
