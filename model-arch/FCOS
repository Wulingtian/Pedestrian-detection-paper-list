FCOS1<--FCNs method
FPN+centerness-->FCOS1 arch
# FCOS1 arch
### FPN(multi-level): handling overlapping bounding boxes.
### centerness: predict the deviation of a pixel to the center of its corresponding bounding box, and down-weight low-quality detected bounding boxes
and merge the detection results in NMS.
# FCOS2 arch
### like most parts of FCOS1, 
### add: 
1.sub box on ground-truth bbox to supervise location (x,y) regression;
2.exp(x)-->ReLU(x);
3.s: the total stride, that scale down regression targets and prevents the gradients from exploding during training;
4.IoU loss-->GIoU loss;
5.final score = pscore * cn --> sqrt(score), pscore is classification score, cn is the predicted center-ness float.
6.real-time
