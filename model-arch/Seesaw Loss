re-balance gradients of positive and negative samples
for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e., mitigation
factor and compensation factor. The mitigation factor
reduces punishments to tail categories w.r.t. the ratio of
cumulative training instances between different categories.
Meanwhile, the compensation factor increases the penalty
of misclassified instances to avoid false positives of tail categories
